# 🧠 Designing Responsible and Fair AI Systems

This project demonstrates how to design, audit, and reflect on responsible and fair AI systems, with a practical focus on facial recognition fairness using the FairFace dataset. It combines theoretical understanding, real-world case studies, hands-on dataset audits, and policy reflection to highlight how responsible AI can be designed, evaluated, and deployed.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Build and audit a facial recognition model for fairness across demographic groups using the FairFace dataset.
- **Key Features:**
  - Data exploration and visualization
  - Data preprocessing and augmentation
  - CNN model training and evaluation
  - Fairness analysis by demographic group
  - Theoretical and ethical reflection

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JimnaSafari/week-7plp.git
   cd week-7plp
   ```
2. **Open the notebook:**
   - Launch `FaceFairRecognition.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. **Install requirements:**
   - Run the first cell to install dependencies (TensorFlow, OpenCV, etc.).
4. **Download the FairFace dataset:**
   - Follow notebook instructions to download from Kaggle.
5. **Run all cells:**
   - Explore data, train the model, and analyze fairness.

## 📊 Data Exploration & Visualization
- Loads FairFace labels and inspects data for missing values and class balance.
- Visualizes race, gender, and age distributions.
- Displays sample images with demographic labels.

## 🛠️ Data Processing
- Encodes categorical labels for race, gender, and age.
- Splits data into training and validation sets.
- Prepares Keras data generators for model input.

## 🤖 Model Training & Evaluation
- Defines and trains a CNN for race classification.
- Plots training/validation accuracy and loss.
- Saves the trained model for inference and deployment.

## 📈 Results & Fairness Analysis
- Evaluates model performance on validation data.
- Analyzes accuracy and error rates by demographic group.
- Visualizes fairness metrics and discusses observed biases.
