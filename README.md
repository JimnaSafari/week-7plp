# 🧠 Designing Responsible and Fair AI Systems

This project addresses the critical need for fairness, transparency, and accountability in artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Through theoretical understanding, real-world case studies, practical dataset audits, and policy reflection, it highlights how responsible AI can be designed, evaluated, and deployed.

## 📘 Project Structure

This assignment is divided into the following key parts:

---

## ✅ Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (30%)

### 📌 Topics Covered:

1. **Algorithmic Bias**  
   - Defined and illustrated with real examples.

2. **Transparency vs Explainability**  
   - Clear distinction and relevance in AI system design.

3. **Impact of GDPR on AI**  
   - How data regulations shape model development in the EU.

4. **Ethical Principles Matching**
   - Justice, Autonomy, Sustainability, and Non-maleficence explained and matched with definitions.

---

## ✅ Part 2: Case Study Analysis (40%)

### 📂 Case 1: Biased Hiring Tool (Amazon)
- Analyzed source of bias (e.g., biased training data).
- Proposed mitigation strategies like:
  - Balanced datasets,
  - Gender-neutral features,
  - Auditable pipelines.
- Defined fairness metrics (e.g., disparate impact ratio, equal opportunity difference).

### 📂 Case 2: Facial Recognition in Policing
- Identified ethical risks such as wrongful arrests and privacy violations.
- Recommended responsible policies including:
  - Transparency requirements,
  - Consent mechanisms,
  - Use restrictions.

---

## ✅ Part 3: Practical Dataset Audit (25%)

### 🔍 Dataset: COMPAS Recidivism

- Tool Used: **AI Fairness 360 (IBM)**  
- Tasks:
  - Analyzed racial bias in recidivism predictions.
  - Generated bias metrics and visualizations (e.g., false positive rates).
  - Wrote a 300-word audit report with findings and proposed mitigation (e.g., reweighting, fair post-processing).
- Deliverables: Python code + audit report.

---

## ✅ Part 4: Ethical Reflection (5%)

A reflective analysis of a personal AI project, highlighting:
- How bias and privacy were addressed,
- Steps taken to ensure compliance with ethical principles,
- The importance of inclusive design.

---

## ⭐ Bonus Task (10%): AI in Healthcare Policy Proposal

Drafted a 1-page **Ethical AI Use in Healthcare Guideline** including:
- ✅ Patient consent protocols
- ⚖️ Bias mitigation strategies
- 🔍 Transparency and auditability

---

## 📦 Deliverables

- ✔️ Written responses (Part 1 & 2)
- ✔️ Python notebook using AI Fairness 360 (Part 3)
